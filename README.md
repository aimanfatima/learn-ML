# Learning Machine Learning

It's been quite some time since I last dived into Machine Learning. I started learning ML back in 2018, I made a couple of projects and did some research work on it. But later I got into Software Engineering, which is mainly what I do. Now that I've started my MS in CS (Fall 2023), I want to get back into ML and learn the concepts in depth this time.

To get started, I plan to complete the [Andrew NG's ML specialization in coursera](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/machine-learning-introduction). There are 3 courses in this specialization (I am only auditing these couses, coz they're not free) - 

1. [Supervised Machine Learning: Regression and Classification](https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning?specialization=machine-learning-introduction)
2. [Advanced Learning Algorithms](https://www.coursera.org/learn/advanced-learning-algorithms?specialization=machine-learning-introduction)
3. [Unsupervised Learning, Recommenders, Reinforcement Learning](https://www.coursera.org/learn/unsupervised-learning-recommenders-reinforcement-learning?specialization=machine-learning-introduction)

This repository will have my notes (arranged weekly and by topic), a to-do list (following the course order), and my progress updates.
